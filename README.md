# Identifying Patterns of Household Energy Consumption in the UK

This repo contains the analysis for the CASA0006 Final Assignment, Data Science for Spatial Systems. This Project aims to answer the following two research questions: 

RQ1 | Can unsupervised clustering effectively segment the English and Welsh population based on electricity and gas consumption behaviour?

RQ2 | How do central heating type, income level and dwelling type correlate with *High, Medium-High, Medium-Low,* and *Low* energy consumption in England and Wales?

The python notebook as well as the rendered pdf are included above
